请逐一检查我的代码是否符合要求，如果不符合，请帮我修改我的代码，并告诉我你具体添加/删除了哪些语句。以下是老师的要求： Inter-process communication: The 4 sections of the crossroads are represented by message queues,
 one per section, vehicles are represented via messages coding the vehicle’s attributes. The approach of
 a high-priority vehicle is notified to the lights process by a signal. The state of traffic lights is stored
 in a shared memory, accessible to the coordinator processes, at least. Communication with the
 display process is carried out via sockets








def process_direction(direction):
    temp_list = []
    while not section_queues[direction].empty():
        temp_list.append(section_queues[direction].get())
    
    processed = []
    for v in temp_list:
        can_pass = False
        opposite_dir = OPPOSITE_DIR[direction]

        # 获取对向车道所有车辆（临时取出）
        opposite_temp = []
        while not section_queues[opposite_dir].empty():
            opposite_temp.append(section_queues[opposite_dir].get())

        # 判断逻辑
        if v.type == "pripri":
            can_pass = True
        else:
            if v.priority == 1:
                can_pass = True
            elif v.priority == 2:
                no_straight = not any(p.priority == 1 for p in temp_list)
                no_straight_opposite = not any(p.priority == 1 for p in opposite_temp)
                can_pass = no_straight and no_straight_opposite
            elif v.priority == 3:
                no_higher = not any(p.priority in [1,2] for p in temp_list)
                no_higher_opposite = not any(p.priority in [1,2] for p in opposite_temp)
                can_pass = no_higher and no_higher_opposite

        # 将对向车辆放回队列
        for p in opposite_temp:
            section_queues[opposite_dir].put(p)

        # 后续处理...
